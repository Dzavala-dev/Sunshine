     * Sunshine was originally built to use OpenWeatherMap's API. However, we wanted to provide
     * a way to much more easily test the app and provide more varied weather data. After all, in
     * Mountain View (Google's HQ), it gets very boring looking at a forecast of perfectly clear
     * skies at 75Â°F every day... (UGH!) The solution we came up with was to host our own fake
     * weather server. With this server, there are two URL's you can use. The first (and default)
     * URL will return dynamic weather data. Each time the app refreshes, you will get different,
     * completely random weather data. This is incredibly useful for testing the robustness of your
     * application, as different weather JSON will provide edge cases for some of your methods.
     *
     * If you'd prefer to test with the weather data that you will see in the videos on Udacity,
     * you can do so by setting the FORECAST_BASE_URL to STATIC_WEATHER_URL below.
